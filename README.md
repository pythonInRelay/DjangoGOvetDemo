### Description

_____________________________________

A Django project designed for a job interview with Finnish Net Solutions

Shortens entered URLs and saves them to a database. Does not create duplicate entries.
URL IDs are saved as an integer for more efficient database storage.

. Could be used for example to:

1. Provide obfuscated URLs for sharing and linking to e.g. customer profiles
2. Protecting sensitive intranet pages
3. Making it less likely web crawlers will index private pages
4. Reduce spam and bot by making urls look like temporary autogenerated strings
5.

and many more.
