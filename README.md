### Description

_____________________________________

A Django project designed for a job interview with Finnish Net Solutions

The service is built and deployed entirely with Django.

Shortens entered URLs and saves them to a database. Does not create duplicate entries.
URL IDs are saved as an integer for more efficient database storage and for an added layer of security.

Could be used for example to:

1. Provide obfuscated URLs for sharing and linking to e.g. internal customer profiles
2. Protecting sensitive intranet pages
3. Reducing the likelihood web crawlers will index pages available to them
4. Reduce bot spam by making urls look like temporary autogenerated strings
5. Help to prevent Search Engine Indexing

as well as to obviously shorten long URL strings.

**Time taken to completion: Roughly 4 hours**
